# Signup Core

This repository contains the official libraries for the core functionality of [signup.cash](https://signup.cash), mostly the client side library and key signer.

## What is Signup?

Signup is a non-custodial platform to build blockchain apps exclusively for Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. You can use this library to request your users to pay, and ask them to sign arbitrary payloads without having to think about security measures and low level transaction building.
