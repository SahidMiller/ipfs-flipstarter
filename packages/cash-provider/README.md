# Signup Provider

This library provides the Signup wallet SDK to the web applications. It's a framework agnostic library that helps you to onboard BCH users, process their transactions or ask them to sign any arbitrary payload with their wallet without having your app exposed to user's private key.

[Signup](https://signup.cash) is a non-custodial in-browser DApp wallet for Bitcoin Cash applications on the web.

## Setup

You can use this package in NodeJS or in the browser (but you will need a bundler for that)

```
npm install @signupcash/provider
```

## Documentation

Check out [our documentation](https://docs.signup.cash) to understand how to work with this library and check out the [examples in Github](https://github.com/signupcash/signup-core/tree/master/packages/provider/examples) for more practical use cases.
