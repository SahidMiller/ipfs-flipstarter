And it's just an IPFS hash behind the scenes \uD83E\uDD2F \r\n\r\nTo see the site directly in IPFS, open [this](https:\/\/ipfs.io\/api\/v0\/name\/resolve?arg=flipstarter.sahidmiller.com) in a new tab and plug the path into this url structure `https:\/\/ipfs.io\/<Path>` or any other gateway.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to **help those who don't want to purchase a server but are worried *\"whoever hosts the site\"* can tamper with the contribution process**.\r\n\r\nBy hosting on IPFS, the front-end is in your control and we open up a market for **simple third-party API's**  to store and broadcast **already signed contributions** *which can't be tampered with!*\r\n\r\nMy goal with this flipstarter is to continue building the infrastructure, God willing, and also to get the word out that it can be done. You can **find instructions on how to start a flipstarter like this yourself [below](#create-a-campaign-in-browser-yourself)** and also [how it works](#how-it-works)\r\n\t",

Contribute to this flipstarter\r\n 2. Follow the \"Claim your reward\" link\r\n 3. Fill out your campaign info and submit\r\n\r\nOnce submitted, you will be redirected to your IPFS flipstarter page (created in browser alone) that has a url like this: \r\n\r\n\t\thttps:\/\/ipfs.io\/ipfs\/Qm123...\r\nFollow these instructions if you'd like to **point your domain to this new IPFS flipstarter page**:\r\n\r\n 1. Add a CNAME record to `gateway.ipfs.io.` \r\n 2. Add a TXT record to `_dnslink` or `_dnslink.<host>` with a value of `\/ipfs\/<your-hash>`\r\n 3. Wait for DNS to propagate. \r\n\r\nOnce finished propagating, your site will also be available at:\r\n\r\n\t\thttps:\/\/ipfs.io\/ipns\/<your.domain.com>\r\n\t\thttps:\/\/dweb.link\/ipns\/<your.domain.com>\r\n\t\thttps:\/\/<your-domain-com>.ipns.dweb.link.com\r\nAnd if you want to try with your own gateway, install go-ipfs from here and navigate to:\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\thttps:\/\/<your-domain-com>.ipns.localhost:8080\r\nAnd feel free to try this with the current URL: flipstarter.sahidmiller.com\r\n\r\n> https:\/\/ipfs.io\/ipns\/flipstarter.sahidmiller.com  \r\n> https:\/\/flipstarter-sahidmiller-com.ipns.dweb.link.com  \r\n> http:\/\/localhost:8080\/ipns\/flipstarter.sahidmiller.com  \r\n\r\nIf that works for you, then thank you for your support! If not, feel free to revoke your contribution, I can't stop you!\r\n\r\n<div id=\"how-does-it-work\"><\/div>  \r\n\r\n## How does it work?\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to purchase a server but *worry that whoever \"hosts the site\" can tamper with the contribution process*, then by hosting on IPFS, you remove this ability for a host to tamper with your site. IPFS is a reasonable alternative to self-hosting and without the front-end in another's control, we can then **use a third party to simply store and relay already signed contributions** *which can't be manipulated to send money anywhere else*.\r\n\r\nAnd if this isn't enough, campaigners who prefer running this service for themselves **can also then enable it so others can use it**, even just contributors to their own flipstarter! God bless! So as a proof of concept, I've done this with my flipstarter. \r\n\r\n**Anyone who contributes to this campaign CAN use my server (linked above) for their own campaign.** Be sure to use the same address you contributed with as the recipient address. If you revoke your contribution, I will stop storing new contributions.\r\n\r\nAfter contributing, follow the \"Claim your reward link\" or use [this direct link to autofill][create-ipfs-api] OR enter the following url in the API field of the Flipstarter Create page form:\r\n\r\n\t\thttps:\/\/api.flipstarter.sahidmiller.com\r\n\r\n## Third-party servers\r\n\r\n### Hosting your own server\r\n\r\nBesides my server mentioned above, you can run your own using the source code available on [ipfs]() and [github]().  I don't have a fancy Droplet for you to run though.\r\n\t\r\n### Experimental browser-based server\r\n\t\r\nI also provide an experimental browser based server for campaigners who **don't want to purchase a server NOR rely on a third party**. This tool exposes the same API above except via LibP2P. It is available on [ipfs]() and [github]().\r\n\t\r\nOnce initialized, you can open the Flipstarter Create page directly and create a campaign for yourself and\/or enable others to do the same. Unfortunately though, the browser must stay open in order to accept contributions.\r\n\r\n\r\n### API specification for alternative third-party API's\r\n\r\nAlthough you can host this code yourself as shown above, you may want to build a compatible third-party API yourself.\r\n\r\n### IPFS Flipstarter Create page\r\nFor future compatibility with the IPFS Flipstarter Create page expected API, the third-party server must implement:\r\n\r\n\t\/create - Accepts a campaign with title, starts, expires, etc. and returns an { id, address }\r\n\r\n###  IPFS Flipstarter Client page\r\nFor future compatibility with the IPFS Flipstarter Client page expected API, the third-party server must implement:\r\n\r\n\t\/submit\/ - Accepts a contribution with campaign_id, previous_transaction_hash, etc. \r\n\t\/events\/:id - Returns \"init\", \"contribution\", \"revocation\", \"fullfilled\" events and data.\r\n\r\nA more fleshed out API specification can be created as a result of this. More IPFS based flipstarter creators and an ecosystem can be fleshed out.\r\n\r\n# Help with DNS and IPNS \r\n\r\nIf you're on linux, you can check DNS with the following commands:\r\n\r\n\t\tdig +noall +answer TXT _dnslink.<your-domain-com>\r\n\t\tdig +noall +answer <your-domain-com>\r\n\r\nOnce finished, you can get the direct hash of the site using the following url:\r\n\r\n\t\thttps:\/\/ipfs.io\/api\/v0\/name\/resolve?arg=<your-domain-com>\r\n\r\nHere's an example:\r\n> https:\/\/ipfs.io\/api\/v0\/name\/resolve?arg=flipstarter.sahidmiller.com\r\n\r\n# General needs I'd like to meet\r\n\r\n### Connection\r\nI'm hoping to be recognized and accepted by the community. I'd also like to cooperate with others on shared goals and to communicate on future work.\r\n\r\n### Physical \r\nI hope to be able to have family, friends, and others fed and with a roof over our heads and with clean water to drink, God willing.\r\n\r\n### Honesty \r\nI want to be authentic, to show integrity and have presence in public.\r\n\r\n### Peace \r\nI hope to inspire myself and others, God willing. I also want to keep the balance of power away from centralization and to make our lives easier.\r\n\r\n### Autonomy \r\nI hope to keep my own freedom of choice and give others more choice in meeting their needs, God willing.\r\n\r\n### Meaning \r\nI want to make a difference, contribute, improve my skillset, and deliver on something meaningful and long lasting, God willing, and I want to discover more ways to do this! Also, I'd like to participate in building, learning, and growing.\r\n\r\n### Play \r\nI'm happy working on this because it's FUN to me.\r\n\r\n## My motivations from the Quran\r\n\r\n> 6:90 These are the ones guided by God; so let their guidance be an example. Say, \"**I do not ask you for a wage**; this is but a reminder for the worlds.\" \r\n\r\n> 11:29 \"My people, **I do not ask you for money, my reward is with God**. Nor will I turn away those who acknowledge, for they will meet their Lord. But I see that you are a people who are ignorant.\" \r\n\r\n> 11:51 \"My people, **I do not ask you for any wage, my wage is from the One who initiated me**. Will you not reason?\"\r\n\r\n> 12:104 **Though you do not ask them for a wage for it**; it is but a reminder to the worlds \r\n\r\n> 25:57 Say, \"**I do not ask you for a wage**; but for whoever chooses to make a path to his Lord.\"\r\n\r\n> 26:109 \"**I do not ask you for a wage**, for my reward is upon the Lord of the worlds.\"\r\n\r\n> 26:127 \"**I do not ask you for a wage**, for my reward is upon the Lord of the worlds.\"\r\n\r\n> 26:145 \"**I do not ask you for a wage**, for my reward is upon the Lord of the worlds.\"\r\n\r\n> 26:164 \"**I do not ask you for a wage** for my reward is upon the Lord of the worlds.\"\r\n\r\n> 26:180 \"**I do not ask you for a wage**, for my reward is upon the Lord of the worlds.\"\r\n\r\n> 36:21 \"Follow those **who do not ask you for any wage**, and are guided.\"\r\n\r\n> 38:86 Say, \"**I do not ask you for any wage**, nor am I a fraud.\"\r\n\r\n> 42:23 Such is the good news from God to His servants who acknowledge and do good works. Say, \"**I do not ask you for any wage**, except that you show compassion to your relatives.\" Whosoever earns a good deed, We shall increase it for him in goodness. Surely, God is Forgiving, Appreciative.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion\r\n\r\nThanks for giving this a read so far.
